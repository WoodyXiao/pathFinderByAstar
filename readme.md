## A* algorithmn to find the shortest path</br>
**Description:**</br>
This is a small project for learning the A* algorithm and practicing the basic usage of C++, This project will find the shortest path bewteen two given points with A* algorithm in C++.  </br>

**Some notes about the algorithm**</br>
> **Formula:** f = g + h + w 
>
> 1. f: The total price for reaching the destination. 
> 2. g: The price that has taken. 
> 3. h: The expected price of reaching the destination without counting walls 
> 4. w: Tradeoff. 
>
>**Types of movement:** 
>1. ←↑→↓ (need 10 for moving, g=10)
>2. ↘↙↖↗ (need 14 for moving, g=14)
